# ContactGrid

This is a small address-book CRUD single page application, made using Angular, MaterialUI, Ag-grid and the In-memory-web-Api to make up for the backend.

it supports various addresses for one user, but will display them in multiple rows in the ag-grid since row grouping is an entreprise feature and i will maybe be making updates in the future.

the application is production ready and is live on heroku via this link : https://carnet-contact.herokuapp.com

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

# Use

contacts are added via the form accessible from the navbar button on the top-right.
ag-grid displays the list of contacts on the homepage that you can also access from the navbar.
double clicking on a contact in ag-grid will take you to the update form.
deleting contacts is done with the delete button, to the right on the ag-grid.
