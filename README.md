# ContactGrid

This is a small address-book CRUD single page application, made using Angular, MaterialUI, Ag-grid and the In-memory-web-Api to make up for the backend.  

it supports various addresses for one user, but will display them in multiple rows in the ag-grid since row grouping is an entreprise feature and i will maybe be making updates in the future.

the application is production ready and is live on heroku via this link : https://carnet-contact.herokuapp.com

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
